      <h1>About</h1>

      <p> MidSouthCon is presented by Mid-South Science and Fictions Conventions, Inc. 
      A 501(c)3 non-profit corporation who uses the convention to promote education and 
      raise money for charities like Literacy Mid-South and the Science Fiction Writers of 
      America Emergency Medical Fund. Over the years we have raised over $65,000 for our charities.
      </p>
      <p>MidSouthCon is the longest-running annual fan-run multi-genre Science Fiction Convention 
      in the Mid-South.  It covers a diverse section of fannish culture that includes science fiction, 
      fantasy, science, comics, horror, education, costuming, anime, and gaming. MidSouthCon has an 
      average of 2200 attendees, including over 100 authors, editors, publishers, scientists, 
      artists and other guests and panelists. It features  more then 200 hours of programing, 
      including panels, our annual Art and and Charity Auctions, Masquerade costume contest, 
      and more. There are also hundreds of hours of gaming running non-stop throughout the weekend.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to all the programing and gaming, MidSouthCon has all the staples of traditional 
      science fiction conventions, including a first class Art Show featuring art for sale by artists 
      from across the country, a well-stocked Dealerâ€™s Room with venders selling a wide variety of 
      genre items, and a Con-Suite with free sodas and munchies where you can quench your thirst, 
      sate your appetite, and schmooze with other attendees.
